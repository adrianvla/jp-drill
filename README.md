# LanDon's Japanese Verb Conjugation Drill
##### Landon's Extension to the widely popular Don's Japanese Conjugation Drill

# About
Forked from the original Don's Japanese Conjugation Drill, LanDon's Extended version brings a bit more features to help you level up your practice sessions.
Verb conjugation can be a complicated thing. Drill yourself on conjugation forms to help you recall patterns for different verb types.
This is a work in progress site.


# How to use
Just like Dons original site, but more stuff.
- Set your initial filters that youd like to receive prompts about and start the game
- the quiz will prompt you with a request to conjugate verbs into a specific change/form
- type out the conjugation you believe it is (english letters will convert to hiragana)
- the quiz will tell you if you are right or wrong and explain why you might be wrong

# Why extend?
I had been using Don's conjugation practice for a while on my own and found it incredibly useful. However, I also really wished that there was more to the site.
- More verbs
- More conjugation options
- More helper verbs
- More adjectives

I noticed that the website was a github site, meaning there could be an active repository of code. However it had been over two years since anyone participated on maintaining the code. 
So I forked it and figured I could continue that work and learn the code base a bit.

# Next Up
- Moreverbs
- More adjectives
- Support filtering by JLPT levels
- Support Filtering by most common verbs
- Add example sentences.
- Add sound bytes
- More redesigning
- Performance improvements ( because more verbs == slower site currently )


# Who is Landon?
You can find a bit of my bio on my page but the short of it is I am a programmer with work history at Disney, Nickelodeon, and worked some time in Japan for a company that made cinematics for Nintendo called Anima.
I am a technology obsessive with my roots as an artist. I dabble in a whole lot of projects ranging from book authorship, music, photography, youtube, and games... to coffee, dogs, whisky, bouldering and more.
I am still studying Japanese and need a solid set of tools to help myself learn. So here we are.
